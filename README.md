# Dino Husnic CS 428 Project 2

> _This has been tested on version 2019.4.28f1 of the Unity software_

## Introduction

My project is for Thassalophobia, or the fear of the ocean/ large bodies of water. There are interactables that can be found on ships and fish in the ocean that might be scary to some, and there is a model of a sea with a ghost ship, an abandoned row boat, a lighthouse, and some fish underneath. There is also a separate office on the other side of the main doors. It is a VR application, so it is intended to be used on a VR headset. 

Thassalophobia can have people not going to the beach, go on boat rides, be scared to interact with sea creatures, and various other things relating to both the sea and bodies of water. There are a few sea creatures in the space that can be seen and interacted with, allowing a person to maybe try to conquer a fear of the sea creatures or at least take a step in that direction. There is a model of a "scary" scenario with a body of water, two ships, and a lighthouse. Bodies of water and scenarios like being on a boat or on the beach can trigger this phobia, but there is a limited space so making a life size island or on a board a ship is not really possible in a small office. A small model of a scenario can work and help a person maybe put it in perspective, and if they can overcome any fear they are feeling here, it is one step closer to overcoming the fear in reality.


## Getting Started

This is the github page for my project. The project runs on Unity 2019.4.28f1 and VRTK version 4. The way to download and access this project is to click the green code button at the top of the project and download the zip folder. Extract all the files in the zip folder. Once the files have been extracted, go into the Unity Hub and click on add. Go to the folder that is needed (MACOSX or ScareCo folder for windows), and the project should be opened after a short time. In the scenes folder, there is a scene called ScareCoOffices. Open that scene and that should bring you to my project. There are two camera settings. Check SpatialCamera for a simulated version using keyboard and mouse or check XRCamera for the VR experience. Run the game using the play button at the top.

## Discussion

There are two different ways that the world can be experienced, through the PC simulator and a VR headset. For the simulator, there are keyboard keys in place of VR controls, so the experience isn’t as immersive. It is also definitely a lot more work to test out interactable objects and know if they function correctly, since the controllers have to be moved individually, and if an interactable wants to be looked at, no movement or camera control is allowed, only manual controller movement. It is also really hard to see something that is located lower to the ground in the simulation mode. There is no sense of movement allowed with the camera except to look around at the same height you spawn in at. This really limits anything that is placed on the ground or below a desk and makes it awkward for the controller to reach a low object. With VR a lot of this is made so much easier. In VR, all the interactables can be picked up and looked around at with a lot more ease. The controller is pretty much your hand movements and more of the environment directly around can be seen in better detail.
Since the world is intended to be seen in VR, a lot of the interactions are smoother and feel cleaner. This has a downside to it though since movement is now limited. Teleporting is there, the same as in the simulated version, but now moving around the area is more awkward. Walking is the one thing the simulated version does that VR isn’t amazing at. There are issues with moving in VR for some people since it simulates walking, yet there is no walking involved for the most part. The desktop simulated version is more easy on people.
